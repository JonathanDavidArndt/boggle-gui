# Boggle-GUI

This is a Java/NetBeans implementation of the popular Boggle board game.

How to use:
* Play a game of Boggle (like a normal human being)
* Enter the letters from your Boggle Board into the program
* Tap the button "Find More Words In Boggle Board"

(Optionally, you and your friends can enter all the words you found while you were playing.)

After that, you will be shown the following information:
* Words you missed
* Words you thought you found (but actually are not on the Boggle Board)
* Things you thought were words (and still might be in your imagination)
